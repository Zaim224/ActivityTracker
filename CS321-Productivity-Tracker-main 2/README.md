Productivity Tracker:
Build of a chrome extension that tracks the user's focus habits through the following features: 
- start/stop button
- productivity breakdown report
- tab tracking
- time tracking
- web-page blocking

Our aim is to provide the breakdown of a user's study session in order to maximize productivity. This is in response to a growing need for more efficiency in working hours. 
There are numerous distractions today that are created to be more eye-catching. We thought up this project as a solution to the distraction economy.

Framework:
- HTML, JavaScript, CSS

Build Status: one feature implemented--the start/stop button.
